This repository contains QA tests for the Phonebook (https://telranedu.web.app/home), a website created for QA testing. 

The goal is to validate key user flows using manual and automated testing and to document the testing process using structured QA documentation (STP, STD, STR).

All credentials in the test data (emails and passwords) are synthetic and used solely for functional testing. They are randomly generated, not reused, and are included to verify behavior like login after registration and password validation.
